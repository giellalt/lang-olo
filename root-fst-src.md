semantic types of adverbs

Semantics are classified with

Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
source and target part-of-speech.
 * +V→N
 * +V→V
 * +V→A
 * +Der
 * **+Der/Tostu** with numerals 11-19
 * +Der/xxx
 * **+Der/Rc** used in verbs for deriving reflexive conjugation
 * +Der/Ta
 * +Der/Te
 * +Der/mA
 * +Der/mine
 * +Der/Tu
 * +Der/IA
 * **+Der/mbi** comparative
 * **+Der/Us** A>>N derivation
 * **+Der/A** Adjective derivation
 * **+Der/MWN** Modifier without Noun head

## Morphophonology
To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:

 **%{aoeInf%}** Back vowel infinitive marker
 **%{äöeInf%}** Front vowel infinitive marker


 * **%{aäPar%}**  no diphthongs
 * **%{aäDiph%}**  This is for diphthongs such as the infinitive marker after i and u stems
 * **%{aäoeöuiy%}**  with partitive type
 * **%{aäoeö%}**  newer This is for diphthongs such as the infinitive marker after i and u stems
 * **%{aäuyiØ%}** in participle endings anticipating PÄIVY or KOIRU type
 * %{aä%}
 * %{oö%}
 * **%{oöØ%}**  Used in present participle
 * %{uy%}
 **%{ui%}** in imperative before %{aä%}:
 * **%{ijPRC%}** participle
 * **%{lnrs%}** e.g. in perfect participles
 * **%{dtlnr%}** e.g. infinitive and Ind+Prs+Pl3

And following triggers to control variation 

 * **%{front%}** front harmony until harmony boundary, i.e. word boundary
 * **%{back%}** back harmony until harmony boundary, i.e. word boundary
* %>
 * %^DEVOICE
 * **%^VOICE**  pestä: pezen
 **%^Pen** pagisou paistah in with WGStem to trigger pen coda
 * **%^WGStem**  weak grade
 * **%^E1**  causes a:e in kandua : kannettu
 * **%^SyllBound**  syllable boundary
 * **%^D2Z** Triggers ti=>zi
 * **%^A2O**  before plural "i"
 * **%^A2U**  +Nom+Sg
 * **%^A2UÄ2Y** with single vowels
 **%^E2O**  the e => o, e => ö +Ind+Prs+ScSg3
 **%^Ä2I**  ä => i
 **%^A2UÄ2I**  a => u, ä => i in consecutive vowels
 **%^V2U**  v => y **kävvä käydy**

 * **%^NONE**  no regular change
 * **%^KS2S**  "aluksen" is "alus" in the nominative singular
 * **%^ILoss**  the i => 0 **reboi reboloi**
 _%^RmVow_ vowel removal, e.g. with superlative

## Symbols that need to be escaped on the lower side (towards twolc):
 * **»7**:  Literal »
 * **«7**:  Literal «
```
 **%[%>%]** - Literal >
 **%[%<%]** - Literal <

## Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 |  **@P.NeedNoun.ON@** | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 |  **@D.NeedNoun.ON@** | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 |  **@C.NeedNoun@** | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 |  **@P.CmpFrst.FALSE@** | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 |  **@D.CmpPref.TRUE@** | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 |  **@P.CmpPref.FALSE@** | Block these words from making further compounds
 |  **@D.CmpLast.TRUE@** | Block such words from entering R
 |  **@D.CmpNone.TRUE@** | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 |  **@U.CmpNone.FALSE@** | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 |  **@P.CmpOnly.TRUE@** | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 |  **@D.CmpOnly.FALSE@** | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 |  **@U.Cap.Obl@** | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 |  **@U.Cap.Opt@** | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
